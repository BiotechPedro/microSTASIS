Title: Microbiota STability ASsessment via Iterative cluStering
Version: 0.99.1
Description: The toolkit 'µSTASIS' has been developed for the stability analysis
            of microbiota in a temporal framework by leveraging on iterative 
            clustering. Concretely, the core function uses Hartigan-Wong k-means
            algorithm as many times as possible for stressing out paired samples
            from the same individuals to test if they remain together for 
            multiple numbers of clusters over a whole data set of individuals. 
            Moreover, the package includes multiple functions to subset samples
            from paired times, validate the results or visualize the output.
